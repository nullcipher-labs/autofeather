a photoshop automation script that iterates over all images in a directory and creates copies of them with a feathered/faded border.

as for the python project itself, it contains four files:
1. autofeather_photoshop.py - contains the function that creates a feathered version of a single image
2. autofeather.py - has all of the GUI logic generated by PyQt5, and some functionality of browsing directories and getting the correct data from the user
3. autofeather_main.py - main file for running with some PyQt5 necessities in it
4. autofeather.ui - PyQt5 file necessary for GUI

each function except the PyQt5 generated ones is well documented in the code.
